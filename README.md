# Smarthomeplaner

A Program which originated from my Bachelorthesis.
The main goal of the Project was a proof of concept Program which enables any User to (visually) configure a Smarthome with the option of getting additional Information
like vulnerabilities and "dataprotection information"(e.g. the locations of the Servers).
The Program consists of:
Backend - Django
Frontend - Vue 
Canvas - FabricJs
